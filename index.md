## This would be the first one

1. What is this all about?
2. How does it look?
3. I would like a soda pop

## I'm guessing this is the title
Should we try some code?

```r
r <- rnorm(1000)
hist(r)
```

![plot of chunk hist](assets/fig/hist-1.png)

## And another
Here's something else

```r
y <- rnorm(1000, mean = 2, sd = 4)
plot(r,y)
```

![plot of chunk scatter](assets/fig/scatter-1.png) 

Thanks, that's it!
