## This would be the first one

1. What is this all about?
2. How does it look?
3. I would like a soda pop

--- .class #id 

## I'm guessing this is the title
Should we try some code?

```r
set.seed(87367836)
r <- rnorm(1000)
hist(r)
```

## And finally for an old classic

```r
print("hello world")
```

```
## [1] "hello world"
```

Thanks, that's it!
